    FEATURES:

      1. Return an :inc-count function
      2. Take a total count update function
      3. Inline (measure 'name') into code
      4. Being able to read rates on demand
      5. Bench a function (in REPL)

    TODO:
     
      1. Have a stop all including publish groups and rates created by macros
      2. Mute publishers (useful if the rates are only read on demand)
      3. Pass params from rate to crate
      4. Stop rate's group publisher (using group false for now, to easier the use from REPL)
